# EmulatorCentral
This software serves as an interface for running emulators on a local machine. If you're using many different types of emulators, this allows you to run any game from any console without having to individually locate each application and ROM.
## Disclaimer
This software does not provide any illegal files (such as any game's ROM itself), nor does it intend to. It is only an interface to run other programs on your device, with an added argument for the file you're attempting to load.
